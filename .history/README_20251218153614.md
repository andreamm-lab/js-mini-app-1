# Interactive Quiz App

## Overview
This project is a **single-page web quiz application** designed to help users **learn English vocabulary** through images and multiple-choice questions.

The user is presented with an image and must select the correct word from several options.  
Immediate feedback is provided after each answer, and a **final score screen** summarizes performance with accuracy, points, and personalized messages.


## Key Features
- Image-based vocabulary questions  
- Multiple-choice answers with instant feedback  
- Configurable game modes (number of questions)  
- Difficulty levels based on time per question  
- Countdown timer per round  
- Final score view with detailed results  
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile  



## Objectives
- Build a **single-page web application** using vanilla JavaScript  
- Practice **DOM manipulation** and event handling  
- Implement **game state management** without frameworks  
- Apply **responsive UI design** principles  
- Use timers, conditional logic, and dynamic content updates  



## Game Modes
The game allows different configurations:
- **5 Questions**
- **7 Questions**
- **10 Questions**

The total number of questions adapts automatically based on the selected mode.


## Difficulty Levels
Difficulty levels adjust the **time limit per question**:
- **Easy**: more time per question  
- **Medium**: standard time  
- **Hard**: reduced time, increasing challenge  

This approach increases difficulty without changing question complexity.



## Languages & Technologies
- **HTML**: semantic structure and accessibility  
- **CSS**: layout, responsive design, visual feedback states  
- **JavaScript**: game logic, timers, score calculation, DOM manipulation  

No external frameworks or libraries were used.



## Design Approach
The design focuses on clarity and usability:
- Clean and readable layout  
- Clear visual feedback for correct and incorrect answers  
- Minimal distractions to support learning  
- Responsive behavior across screen sizes  

Images are used as the main learning stimulus to reinforce vocabulary retention.
